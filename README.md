# crash-fix

INSTALL:

create a new folder called pak01_dir, inside that folder create a new one named scripts, and in that one another named talker

take biker.txt and coach.txt and place them inside the talker folder
the install path should look like this:

pak01_dir
>scripts
>>talker
>>>biker.txt
>>>coach.txt

convert pak01_dir into a vpk by dragging it onto vpk.exe located inside Left 4 Dead 2/bin

then place pak01_dir.vpk inside the server folder

if you already have a pak01_dir.vpk then just repack it with the new files inside
